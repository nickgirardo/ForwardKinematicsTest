Simple forward kinematics system in two dimesions

## Check it out
You can check out a demonstration running on my github.io [here](http://nickgirardo.github.io/animation-tests/forward-kinematics/).

## Running
Webpack is used to build a bundle. During development, you can run `npm run start:dev` to run an instance of webpack-dev-server and test locally.
A finished bundle can be built with `npm run publish`.
